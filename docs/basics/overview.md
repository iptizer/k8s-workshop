## yaml

[Yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human readable data serialization language. Ã–hh. It means you can have "single value", "list" or "maps".

Example:

```yaml
singleValue: "This is a single value"
listValues:
  - "this is the first item"
  - "this is the second item"
mapValues:
  myFirstMapValue: "yes. My first map value."
  mySecondMapValue: "oh yes. This is my second map value"
```
