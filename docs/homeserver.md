# Homeserver

The last chapters focused on basics and exploration. This chapter will focus on deploying an actual Kubernetes cluster. But also for this setup a local development setup can be used. The idea is to use a different repository that you can later also use for your personal setup.

To get started, head over to this repository and use it as a template repository: [https://github.com/iptizer/k8s-kubespray-template](https://github.com/iptizer/k8s-kubespray-template)

You can either use it on GitHub as a template repository or check it out and later push it to your own git server.
