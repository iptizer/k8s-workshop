Monitoring can be quite a complex task, as it not only requires tools and connecting them. It also requires dashboards and senseful alert thresholds. This is very time consuming and requires a lot of experience.

Copy the following text into a file called `helm_prometheus-stack.yaml`.

```yaml
myyaml: xxx
```
